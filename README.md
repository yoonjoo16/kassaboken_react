## Description

In December 2020, I made a cashbook program with JavaServer Pages(JSP) for me and my partner. We used the page about 1 year, but I wanted to practice React. Moreover, the hosting for JSP homepage costs monthly and I wanted to save money using Firebase for free :)

## What are used?

- Node.js
- React
- Firebase
- Material UI for design

## Process

- June 2021 : Started planning and made a project in Github (https://github.com/yoonjoo16/kassaboken_react/projects/1)
- October 2021 : Made main functions adding and editing the cashbook
- November 2021 : Tried deploying the page on Github
- December 2021 : Added small functions - to add places, filter the records by month and year
- January 2022 : Finished the pages for guests and made profile page. Deployed the page using Firebase hosting

## What I've learned

- How to use React Hook
- How to use Firebase Authentication, database and hosting

## What to do in the future

- Finish the page for statistics
- learn Redux to organize the states better
- Learn more about database
